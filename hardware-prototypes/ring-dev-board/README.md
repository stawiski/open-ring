# Description

The purpose of these prototypes was to test different smart ring hardware designs and components to find the best solution for the final product, mainly:
- different capacitive touch sense designs (there was space left on the PCB to connect different touch sense strips)
- different haptic feedback motors
- different antenna positions (hence why we made separate horizontal and vertical antenna PCBs)

These prototypes don't include battery charging or power management solution, which exists in the final product.

The PCBs were manufactured as 2 layer rigid FR4 at 0.6mm thickness which doesn't resemble the final board stackup, but was as thin as possible before the board becomes fully flex.
The main bit of this PCB that needed later adjustment was the BLE antenna circuit, as the stackup influences the impedance a lot.
