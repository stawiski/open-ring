# Description

The purpose of this prototype was to compare different induction charger coil designs and pick the best one in terms of size, charging efficiency, charging area, charging distance, and number of layers.

Generally when dealing with induction charging like this, we're dealing with an air-gapped transformer. The primary coil in the charger is the transmitter and the secondary coil in the ring is the receiver.

Therefore, two coils are needed for the charging solution. We tested various coil sizes and shapes at different ring sizes (which determine the coil bending curve) to determine the best coil design for all ring sizes (US6 to US13).

The PCB was manufactured as a 2 layer flex board at 0.2mm thickness to resemble the final board stackup as close as possible.
