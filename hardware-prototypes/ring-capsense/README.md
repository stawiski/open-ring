# Description

The purpose of this prototype board was to compare different capacitive touch sense designs and pick the best one. Since the ring has a floating ground, the touch sense used mutual capactitance method (implemented by Atmel's QTouch).

The aim of this capacitive touch strip was to detect single finger taps and swipes (ideally with positional swipe for volume adjustment).

The PCB was manufactured as a 2 layer flex board at 0.2mm thickness to resemble the final board stackup as close as possible.
